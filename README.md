# Cricket-Fantasy-League-Game

This is a fantasy cricket game. It was developed as part of Internshala's Programming with Python course. The game allows you to create a virtual team of cricketers and calculate their  points for the performance of the players  in different games. Only one match has been included for simplicity. You can create different teams of players and find out their score in the game. The application is developed using Python and SQLite database. The games user interface is designed with QT Designer.

Use this only as a guide for your project. Please do not upload it for your final project on Internshala python training course. Your final project must be your own original work.
